# Create a flexbox with the following properties:

    - 7 containers with colours: AliceBlue, AntiqueWhite, BurlyWood, Cornsilk, DeepSkyBlue, FloralWhite and LightCyan
    - Each container should have a min-width of 100px, height: 200px.
    - The containers should flow to the next line if they don't fit into one line.
    - Containers are evenly distributed in the line; the first item is on the start line, the last item is on the end line.
    - If we click any containers, the non-click containers should display text 'Please click me', and the clicked containers should display text 'LaLa' with the order they have been clicked.
    - After all the containers have been click, the containers should back to their initial state.
    - We also need a button that can change the containers to their initial state.
